Customer churn, refers to customers who cease using a bank's services. Retaining existing customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new ones, making churn a critical financial concern for banks. This project aims to analyse customer data to identify factors influencing churn and develop a predictive model to anticipate customer departure. This project dives deep into bank data which is obtained from Kaggle. By analysing trends and patterns associated with customers who leave, we can uncover the key factors driving churn in this industry. This knowledge will be used to build a powerful model, whether statistical or machine learning based, that predicts the likelihood of a customer leaving. Evaluating this model's performance ensures its accuracy in identifying at-risk customers. Ultimately, the project aims to provide the bank with actionable insights to develop targeted customer retention strategies, fostering happier customers and a thriving bank.
